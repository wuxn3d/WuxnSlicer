## Summary 

WuxnSlicer is the recommended software for converting 3D objects into specific instructions for Wuxn 3D printers. WuxnSlicer is a derivative of Ultimaker Cura. At the heart of Ultimaker Cura is its powerful, open-source slicing engine, built through years of expert in-house development and user contributions. WuxnSlicer + Wuxn Printers + Wuxn Filament have been engineered to optimize print performance, quality, strength, and speed.
